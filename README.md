### tedex
tedex or ted index is a tool for watching random ted talks. It is best to use the github page (insert link here).

NOTE: the data set is from 9 years ago

### How to gen new list
To create a new list of talks run the app.py file with the compatible data set. The data set used to generate the list.js file is here (https://github.com/pixelastic/tedtalks-audio-list). Your data set will need a video link and thumbnail link, you may need to change the python to run your own data set.

### Licencing and attribution.
The data set is taken from https://github.com/pixelastic, the videos are streamed from download.ted.com and the rest of the code is mine licenced under MIT no warranty.
